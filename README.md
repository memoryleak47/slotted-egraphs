Slotted E-Graphs
================

In this repository we've implemented slotted e-graphs.

For a higher level introduction to slotted e-graphs, consider
* the [PLDI pre-print (2025)](https://steuwer.info/files/publications/2025/PLDI-2025.pdf)
* the [workshop talk (2024)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Cg365LVbYg)
* the [workshop pre-print (2024)](https://michel.steuwer.info/files/publications/2024/EGRAPHS-2024.pdf)

For an example implementation of a Language with binders in slotted e-graphs,
consider the RISE implementation in [here](https://github.com/memoryleak47/slotted-egraphs/tree/main/tests/rise/mod.rs).
